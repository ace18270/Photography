## Welcome to My Portfolio 

Over the years I've really loved to pick up my camera and take pictures to try and remember the beautiful memories of life. 

I hope that as you go on through my website, you enjoy what you are able to enjoy my work. 

### Photos

The main subject of most of my photos are photography. I enjoy taking photos of people, but when I can, I find it best to try and capture the marvels of the world
Here is a picture from one of my trips to China:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ace18270/henlo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
