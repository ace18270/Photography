## Welcome to My Portfolio 

Over the years, I've really loved to pick up my camera and take pictures to try and remember the beautiful memories of life. 

I hope that as you go on through my website, you enjoy what you are able to enjoy my work. 

### Scenery

The main subject of most of my photos are photography. I enjoy taking portraits, but when I can, I find it best to try and capture the marvels of the world
Here is a picture from one of my trips to China:

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Food

As a person, food is one of my major sources of entertainment, so of course I spend a lot of my time trying to capture my joy in the photos I take of the actual food. Oftenly, you'll notice that most of my photos are taken during vacations, for these moments are the most exotic and unique for me as the photographer. The following photo I will attach is actually the fruit part of a giant buffet party for Thai New Year.
